# Product Context: AIESEMAR

## Why This Project Exists
ASMR enthusiasts often seek a tailored listening experience with enhanced audio controls, especially for offline content. Existing video players may lack specialized audio features like bass boost, which are important for ASMR enjoyment.

## Problems Solved
- Lack of offline video players with ASMR-focused audio controls.
- Inability to easily boost bass frequencies for a more immersive ASMR experience.
- Need for a simple, user-friendly interface for loading and playing local video files.

## How It Should Work
- User opens the application in their browser or as a desktop app.
- User clicks a button to select and load a video file from their device.
- The video is displayed in a custom player with standard controls (play, pause, seek, volume).
- Additional controls allow the user to adjust bass boost in real time.
- All features work offline, with no need for an internet connection.

## User Experience Goals
- Fast and intuitive video loading.
- Smooth, responsive playback.
- Clear, accessible controls for both video and bass boost.
- Visually appealing and distraction-free interface.
- Reliable offline operation.
