# Progress: AIESEMAR

## What Works
- Project structure is established with Next.js, Payload CMS, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
- Memory bank initialized and documentation started.
- Core configuration files and directories are present.

## What's Left to Build
- Offline video player component.
- File picker for loading local video files.
- Custom video player UI with standard controls.
- Bass boost audio controls for ASMR playback.
- Integration of bass boost processing (likely via Web Audio API).
- UI/UX enhancements for accessibility and ASMR focus.
- Testing and validation of offline functionality.

## Current Status
- Initial setup and documentation phase.
- No video player or audio processing features implemented yet.

## Known Issues
- None identified at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Chosen to prioritize offline functionality and ASMR-specific audio controls.
- Adopting pnpm, ky, and react-query as standard tools per project rules.
