# Active Context: AIESEMAR

## Current Work Focus
- Initializing the memory bank for the project.
- Analyzing the initial codebase structure and configuration.
- Documenting project requirements, context, architecture, and technology stack.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md.
- Populated each file with content based on the project description and detected file structure.

## Next Steps
- Complete memory bank initialization by creating progress.md.
- Perform a deeper analysis of the codebase, focusing on:
  - Existing components and UI structure.
  - How video playback and audio processing are currently handled (if implemented).
  - Identifying where to implement the video player and bass boost features.
- Update documentation as new insights are gained.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Adhering to project conventions for file structure and technology usage.
- Prioritizing offline functionality and ASMR-specific audio controls.
- Using pnpm, ky, and react-query as per project rules.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project is structured for modularity and scalability, with clear separation between UI, logic, and backend/admin features.
- Tailwind CSS and Payload CMS are integrated for styling and content management.
